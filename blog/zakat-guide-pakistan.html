                    This educational guide explains how Zakat is generally calculated and given: the Nisab concept, standard rate, who is obligated to pay, eligible recipients, and practical steps. It is designed to complement our Zakat calculator and help you discuss your situation with scholars or advisers.

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">☪️ What Is Zakat?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Zakat</strong> is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is a mandatory form of charity for Muslims who meet certain wealth conditions. It is often translated as “purification,” because it purifies both wealth and the heart by sharing a portion of one’s surplus with people in need.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-emerald-50 border-l-4 border-emerald-400 p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-emerald-900 mb-2 text-xl">💚 The Essence of Zakat</p>
                    <p class="text-emerald-800 text-lg">
                        For eligible Muslims, Zakat is typically paid once a lunar year at a standard rate of <strong>2.5%</strong> (one‑fortieth) of qualifying wealth that has stayed above the Nisab threshold for a full lunar year.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">📊 Standard Zakat Rate</h2>

                <div class="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-400 p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-indigo-900 mb-2 text-2xl">2.5% (One‑Fortieth)</p>
                    <p class="text-indigo-800 text-lg">
                        For most types of personal wealth such as cash, savings, gold, silver and many investments, the widely applied Zakat rate is <strong>2.5%</strong> on the amount held above Nisab for one lunar year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-indigo-700 mt-3">
                        A common way to express this is: Zakat amount equals qualifying wealth multiplied by 0.025.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">💰 Nisab Threshold – Gold and Silver</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Nisab</strong> is the minimum level of wealth a Muslim must have before Zakat becomes obligatory. Classical guidance links Nisab to specific weights of gold and silver: around <strong>87.48 grams of gold</strong> or <strong>612.36 grams of silver</strong>, converted into local currency using current market prices.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How Nisab Is Usually Worked Out</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-800">
                        <li>Check the current market price of gold and silver per gram in your area.</li>
                        <li>Multiply the price by 87.48 grams for gold Nisab, or 612.36 grams for silver Nisab.</li>
                        <li>Compare your total Zakatable wealth to these amounts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Gold vs Silver Nisab</h3>
                <p>
                    Many contemporary scholars note that using the silver Nisab leads to a lower monetary threshold, which means more people become eligible to pay Zakat and more recipients are supported. Others prefer the gold Nisab for consistency with wealth standards.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Which Nisab Should I Use?</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-800">
                        In practice, people often follow the opinion of trusted local scholars or organisations in their country when choosing between gold and silver Nisab, especially when using mixed assets like cash, jewellery and investments.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">✅ Who Is Required to Pay Zakat?</h2>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Basic Conditions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being a Muslim.</li>
                    <li>Having reached maturity and soundness of mind.</li>
                    <li>Owning wealth at or above Nisab, beyond essential needs and debts.</li>
                    <li>Keeping that level of wealth for a full lunar year (known as <em>hawl</em>).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">People Usually Exempt</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Those whose net wealth never reaches the Nisab level during the year.</li>
                    <li>People whose debts reduce their net Zakatable wealth below Nisab.</li>
                    <li>Children and those who are not of sound mind, with some differences of opinion about how guardians handle their wealth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">💎 Common Zakatable Assets</h2>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Cash and Bank Balances</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cash at home and in wallets.</li>
                    <li>Current and savings accounts.</li>
                    <li>Foreign currency holdings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Gold and Silver</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gold and silver jewellery, coins and bars.</li>
                    <li>Mixed‑metal jewellery, where the gold/silver component is valued separately.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Differences of Opinion on Jewellery</p>
                    <p class="text-yellow-800">
                        Schools of Islamic law differ on whether personal gold and silver jewellery used only for adornment is always Zakatable, partly Zakatable, or exempt. Many Pakistani scholars follow opinions that treat such jewellery as Zakatable once Nisab is reached.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Investments and Business Assets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shares and unit trusts, usually valued at their current market value when held for investment.</li>
                    <li>Business inventory and goods intended for sale.</li>
                    <li>Amounts owed to you (receivables) that you reasonably expect to be paid.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4. Retirement and Long‑Term Savings</h3>
                <p>
                    Treatment of retirement and pension funds can vary depending on whether you have access to the funds, how they are structured, and the advice of your scholars. Many guides distinguish between locked‑in funds versus savings you can withdraw.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">❌ Assets Usually Not Subject to Zakat</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your main home that you live in.</li>
                    <li>Personal vehicles used for transport rather than trade.</li>
                    <li>Everyday personal items such as clothes, furniture and household appliances.</li>
                    <li>Business equipment and machinery used to generate income, rather than held for sale.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
                    Rental property is often treated differently: the property itself may not be Zakatable, but net rental income that has been saved can be.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">🎯 Eligible Categories to Receive Zakat</h2>

                <p>
                    The Quran lists eight categories of people who may receive Zakat, including the poor, the needy, those in debt and those working to administer Zakat.Within these categories, scholars have identified many practical situations where people may be eligible, such as struggling families, orphans and students of Islamic knowledge.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">People Usually Not Given Zakat</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents, grandparents and direct ascendants.</li>
                    <li>Children, grandchildren and direct descendants.</li>
                    <li>A spouse, because their support is already an obligation.</li>
                    <li>People who clearly have wealth above Nisab and are not in need.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-emerald-900 mb-2">Giving Zakat to Relatives</p>
                    <p class="text-emerald-800">
                        Many scholars encourage giving Zakat to eligible relatives such as siblings, aunts, uncles and in‑laws if they genuinely fall into one of the needy categories, as this supports both family ties and social welfare.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">⏰ When Is Zakat Paid?</h2>

                <p>
                    Zakat becomes due after a full lunar year has passed while your wealth has remained above Nisab. Many people choose a recurring date, often in Ramadan, to assess their wealth and pay Zakat for simplicity and consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paying earlier in the year as an advance is generally accepted by many scholars, particularly when there is clear need, as long as it is reconciled at your Zakat date.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">💳 Zakat and Income Tax in Pakistan</h2>

                <p>
                    In Pakistan, Zakat is a religious obligation, while income tax is a legal obligation under state law. For tax purposes, amounts paid as Zakat under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance or through recognised channels can usually be claimed as a deductible allowance, reducing taxable income for the relevant year.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    The exact mechanism for claiming Zakat as an allowance or credit is described in the Income Tax Ordinance and FBR guidance, and can change over time.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Direct Support</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing funds directly to known individuals or families who are eligible.</li>
                    <li>Helping with essential needs such as food, housing or education expenses where they qualify.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Via Trusted Organisations</h3>
                <p>
                    Many Islamic charities and welfare organisations operate Zakat funds and publish how they distribute them. It is important to check that an organisation clearly separates Zakat funds from general donations and allocates them to eligible categories.

                    <p class="text-yellow-800">
                        Before donating, look for transparent reporting, clear Zakat policies and, where possible, registration or oversight by reputable bodies. This helps you fulfil both the spiritual and practical responsibilities of Zakat.

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Do I pay Zakat on my monthly salary?</h3>
                <p>
                    Zakat is generally calculated on savings and wealth that remain with you, not on each salary payment as it comes in. If part of your salary is saved and your overall wealth stays above Nisab for a year, that saved portion typically becomes Zakatable.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Do I pay Zakat on my home and car?</h3>
                <p>
                    In most guides, your main residence and personal vehicle are not Zakatable assets, although any savings or investments you hold alongside them still are.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What about money I have lent to others?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you reasonably expect the loan to be repaid, some scholars advise including it in your Zakat calculation; if the debt seems unlikely to be recovered, they suggest waiting until you actually receive it before paying Zakat on it.
                </p>
